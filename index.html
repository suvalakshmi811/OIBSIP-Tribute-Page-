        <h2>About Albert Einstein</h2>
        <p>
            Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (the other being quantum mechanics). He is best known for his mass-energy equivalence formula E=mc².
        </p>
        <p>
            Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. His groundbreaking work in physics revolutionized our understanding of the universe and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.
        </p>
        <p>
            His contributions to science and humanity go beyond his theories. He was a passionate advocate for civil rights, pacifism, and education. His wisdom and insights continue to inspire scientists and thinkers around the world.
        </p>
        <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
    <p>
        Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. He showed an early aptitude for mathematics and physics. He attended the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich and graduated in 1900.
    </p>

    <h2>Theory of Special Relativity (1905)</h2>
    <p>
        In 1905, Einstein published his theory of special relativity, introducing the famous equation <em>E=mc²</em>, which expresses the equivalence of mass (<em>m</em>) and energy (<em>E</em>).
    </p>

    <h2>Theory of General Relativity (1915)</h2>
    <p>
        Einstein's theory of general relativity proposed that gravity is the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. It predicted phenomena like the bending of light by gravity, later confirmed during a solar eclipse.
    </p>

    <h2>Nobel Prize in Physics (1921)</h2>
    <p>
        In 1921, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, providing further support for the concept of quantized energy levels.
    </p>

    <h2>Advocacy for Peace and Civil Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Einstein was not only a scientist but also a vocal advocate for civil rights, pacifism, and social justice. He used his fame to promote these causes and was involved in various humanitarian organizations.
    </p>

    <h2>Emigration to the United States</h2>
    <p>
        Due to the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany, Einstein emigrated to the United States in 1933 and accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.
    </p>

    <h2>Atomic Bomb Concerns</h2>
    <p>
        Einstein played a role in raising awareness about the potential destructive power of nuclear weapons. He signed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939, encouraging the U.S. to develop atomic weapons as a deterrent.
    </p>

    <h2>Later Life and Legacy</h2>
    <p>
        Albert Einstein continued to work in theoretical physics and became an icon of scientific genius. He passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey. His legacy continues to influence physics and inspire scientists worldwide.
